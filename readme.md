## README

Doing NLP is just one of my pastimes. I decide to see it more as a challenge that spices up my life than a compulsary task to complete.

This notebook is a collection of what I have done so far. I reckon it could also serve as a guide/roadmap for other non-majors (like me).

Did Task 1 Text Classification based on ML, from a series of elementary NLP tasks in [Fudan nlp-beginner](https://github.com/FudanNLP/nlp-beginner). 

My roadmap (with hindsight): 

- Learn the Basics: NumPy, vector and matrix multiplication in Linear Algebra, partial derivative in Calculus
- Grasp some concepts via Andrew Ng's video (course 1-2). It gives beginners intuitions about what the machine is doing in general ML. 
- Learn the key steps in a text classification task. --> Theoretical chapters in *Natural Language Processing Crash Course for Beginners* (on text preprocessing, tokenization, vectorization).
- be familiar with the derivation of algorithms in ML books, incl. linear/logistic/softmax regression. I read NNDL by Prof. Qiu (a nice book but took me tons of efforts, not recommended for rio beginners).
- (task-specific) Refer to implementations by past students for technical difficulties
